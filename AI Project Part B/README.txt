To run the fuzzy logic expert system. Place both the ".m" and ".fis" in the same directory
and in MATLAB enter the name of the m file, "MarriageDecisionMakerScr"

The program will prompt for input numbers, and after they are entered the compatbility will
be calculated. The fuzzy toolbox will open automatically where you can view the system.
